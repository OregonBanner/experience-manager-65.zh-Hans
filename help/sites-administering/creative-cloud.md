# 与Adobe Creative Cloud共享文件夹 {#folder-sharing-with-adobe-creative-cloud}

>[!CAUTION]
>
>已弃用AEM到Creative Cloud的文件夹共享功能。 建议客户使用较新的功能，例如 [Adobe资源链接](https://helpx.adobe.com/cn/enterprise/using/adobe-asset-link.html) 或 [AEM桌面应用程序](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-desktop-app/using/using.html?lang=en). 了解详情，请参阅 [AEM和Creative Cloud集成最佳实践](/help/assets/aem-cc-integration-best-practices.md).

<!-- TBD: This article is removed from TOC and is not published. The functionality does not exist.

Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets lets you share folders containing assets with Adobe Creative Cloud users. For details on how to configure Adobe Marketing Cloud to let you share assets with Adobe Creative Cloud, see [Configuring Assets-Creative Cloud integration](/help/sites-administering/configure-assets-cc-integration.md).

1. In the Assets console, select a folder to share with Creative Cloud.
